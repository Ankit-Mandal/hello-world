Saying Hello to the World!

I'm SleepyOwl, half awake, half Sleepy,
but if you've got food, I'll be there in a jiffy.
I'm learning to code, mind you, one small step at a time,
and as I've got a job now, I can proudly say, it's on my dime.
I have a dream that someday I'll crack FANG,                                   ###  F- Facebook, A-Amazon, N-Netflix, G-Google
but before that, I need to have my own coder gang.
A gang, which has the same dream as me,
to let our inner bird out, and set them free.
With that in mind, I've also joined Discord,
in the ocean of knowledge we'll forge our sword.
A sword, which will keep us out of harm's way,
but will still let us take charge, like Gandalf the Grey.
